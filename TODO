- send parameters as a flat vector, do not use map as an accumulator. DONE
- send only needed parameters, store result that matters in a global var
- inline simple functions
- do calculation only when needed (see calc-estimate-use: new-value
  calculation and later room check)
- keep solution in external store (atom)
